In this project, we explored the Spotify usage of some of our classmates, as well as Billboard and a few other websites to gather information on public listening habits. We started by getting our classmates to authorize our use of their Spotify information. We turned that information into usable tables that we could then make into mySQL tables. We also used the Billboard website and a Spotify article to "webscrape" or extract data from it using the HTML code behind the website. This gave us information on popular artists, songs, and genres. Using both sets of data, we could then compare our classmates' listening habits to those of the general public, looking for similarities and differences.
