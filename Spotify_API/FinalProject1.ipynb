With that token, we will then be able to access a specified amount of data about that user and their Spotify account, and use this to study listening patterns of our class."

Unfortunately we were only able to get 6 people including us, because a couple codes timed out before we could get to them since they were sent after the class period was over. Once we went to use the refresh token and obtain new access tokens, another couple users didn't work, so that left us with 6 people. This definitely turned out to be a bit of an issue once we attempted to start collecting data, because having more people would have just helped us find trends easier."

    "We used only a slightly different version to collect multiple tokens than the only you gave to us. We changed the data dictionary according to the specifications in Spotify's Documentation, so that it had all of the necessary information in the post body to communicate with Spotify. We also changed the original function so that we collected both the refresh token and the access token in the tokenmap, after realizing that we needed both since the token was only good for an hour. We changed it to collect both when we only received Hieu's access token, and realized afterwards that we had no way to get to his refresh token, which was necessary for when we wanted to do data collection. This was easily fixable because Hieu could just request a new code. Luckily we didn't need to get more codes from the class, since we changed it in time to get the refresh token from everyone else."
