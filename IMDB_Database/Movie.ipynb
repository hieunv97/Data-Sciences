    "In this project, we worked with the IMDB data base, which is a set of tables on different movies data. Each of this table has a primary key and is conformed to third normal form constraints, which state that each row represents exactly one observation and each column represents exactly one variable. The set of tables also follow a set of relationship using their primary key. We began this project with a set of questions that might be answered by using database: According to the IMDB data, what types of movies are the most popular? Then, how did the genre's popularity develop to present day? We moved on to the next realm of analysis, which is the questions on the demographic data of movies. Specifically, we want to explore the difference in number of actors and actresses by year to see if there is a significant difference between two numbers. Lastly, we questioned that some actors and actresses have a \"one-hit wonder\" that make them successful and lead to the high rating among all of their movies. Using Game of Thrones, one of the most famous series in recent years, we are going to examine the difference in the these actors and actresses movies rating with and without Game of Thrones."

    " This is a bar graph displaying the number of movies in each genre of all time plotted against one another. This graph showed us, in terms of genre, how popular drama is with a count of 221,702 movies. There are by far more drama movies on IMDB than any other genre. In fact, the drama genre leads the second most popular genre,comedy, by a count of nearly 73,000 titles. This gaping differential in genre popularity initially took us by surprise, but it actually makes sense, as by inspection, we realized just how many episodes there are of random day-time soap operas and other drama shows. Given that the IMDB database contains both movies and TV shows and even some video games, this differential can definitely be accounted for  by the presence of all of those drama TV shows. \n"

    "   This line plots show the development of genre popularity by year, as each line represent a genre and the count of movies. As we can see, Comedy surprisingly appears to be the first genre developed in 1890 and other genre started to appear in the 1900s to make a collection of different genres for the movie industries. Drama started to overwhelm other genres in its movies count by the 1920s. At some period of time like 1980s and 1990s, Comedy catched up and exceeded Drama in the movies count. However, since the 2000s, number of Drama movies has been growing exponentially with a steep slope of line. We can also see the declining of Comedy and the raising of Action in recent years\n",

    "The graph below shows us the difference between number of actor and actress in the industry. Male was the gender that initially took the main parts in the industry in 1910s. It was in 1930s when there was emergence in the number of actress in the industry. However, as we can see, the blue area, indicating the number of male actor, always double the pink area, indicating the number of female actors. This indicate a significant difference in the number of actors and actresses over time, as actor's count has always been overwhelmed that of actress. Further research on theater history or woman studies should take this phenomenal demographical difference into account to examine the reasoning behind this."
